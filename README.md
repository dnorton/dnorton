Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm a principal software engineer at [The Contract Network](https://www.thecontractnetwork.com/)

Happy to chat about AWS, trail running, 🍺, or UGA football.

Check out some of my favorite [running and cycling routes](./awesome-routes/).

You can find me on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@thednorton) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dnorton.dev).

Kindness first. Prost! 🍻
