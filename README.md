Hi, I'm Daniel! I'm a principal software engineer at [The Contract Network](https://www.thecontractnetwork.com/)

Currently exploring AI and GoLang. Previously focused on data engineering, cloud architecture, and platform engineering.

Happy to chat about AWS, trail running, or UGA football.

Find me on [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@thednorton) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dnorton.dev).

Kindness first. Prost! üçª
